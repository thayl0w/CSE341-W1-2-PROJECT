# CSE341-W1-2-PROJECT
This project will provide an API for storing and retrieving information about contacts. These contacts will be stored in a MongoDB database and all interaction will happen through the API that you create. You will not need to create a frontend for this project, instead you are creating the API that could be used by any frontend in the future.
